  description: "Aerojolt is a sleek, bird-like Pok\xE9mon with electric blue feathers
    and sharp, lightning bolt-shaped wings. It's known for its incredible speed and
    agility, and it's often seen darting through stormy skies, harnessing the power
    of thunderstorms. Its electric abilities are not only used for offense but also
    to navigate through turbulent weather. Aerojolt's eyes have a distinct, electrifying
    glow that intensifies when it's charged up."
