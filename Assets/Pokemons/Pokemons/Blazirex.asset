  description: "Blazirex is a larger and more formidable Fire-type Pok\xE9mon that
    still maintains the adventurous spirit of Firaxle. It has evolved into a bipedal
    creature with even more pronounced red-orange scales and a majestic, flame-shaped
    crest on its head. Blazirex's tail flame has grown larger and more intense, and
    its eyes exude a determined and fiery gaze."
