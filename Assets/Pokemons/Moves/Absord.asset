  description: "Absorb deals damage and the user will recover 50% of the HP drained.\r\n\r\nIf
    the user is holding a Big Root, the move instead recovers 65% of the damage dealt
    (30% more than normal). If used on a Pok\xE9mon with the ability Liquid Ooze,
    the user instead loses the HP it would have otherwise gained."
