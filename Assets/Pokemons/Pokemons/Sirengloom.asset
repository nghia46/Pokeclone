  description: "Sirengloom is a mysterious and elegant Pok\xE9mon that resembles
    a ghostly mermaid. It has a translucent, watery appearance with long, flowing,
    ethereal hair-like tendrils. Sirengloom's eyes emit a soft, haunting glow, and
    it's often seen singing melancholic melodies by the shores at night. It is known
    to lure sailors and trainers with its mesmerizing songs, leading them to ghostly
    shipwrecks on the ocean floor."
