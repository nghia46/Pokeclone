  description: "Pyrodrake is a magnificent Fire-type Pok\xE9mon that embodies the
    essence of a powerful and majestic dragon. It has grown significantly in size
    and now stands tall on powerful hind legs. Its scales have taken on a deep crimson
    hue, with blazing orange wings that can generate intense heat. Pyrodrake's tail
    is a blazing inferno, and its eyes radiate wisdom and strength."
